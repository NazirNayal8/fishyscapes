# Anomaly Detection for Semantic Segmentation
Anomaly detection and uncertainty estimation from deep learning models is subject of active research. However, fundamental ML research is often evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR and similar datasets. In teh Fishyscapes Benchmark, we test how such methods transfer into the much more complex task of semantic segmentation.
